## About Truth Seekers
Curb the spread of fake news, ensuring only reliable articles from trusted sources are promoted with the help of validation experts and by providing a community-driven platform.

## Inspiration
News articles found online are usually from untrusted sources and are unverified. The community is at a high risk of falling into the trap of believing fake news articles. Spreading fake news can have severe repercussions such as heavy fines and possibly even jail time. Especially during this period of the pandemic, fake news can lead to mass panic.

## What it does
Our application aims to curb the spread of fake news using the EOSIO blockchain platform, ensuring only reliable articles from trusted sources are promoted with the help of validation experts and by providing a community-driven platform.

## How we built it
Using the EOSIO Javascript API for integration with EOSIO-based blockchain, the mobile application was developed using the Flutter SDK and Firebase.

## Challenges we ran into
One of the initial challenges we faced was the installation of the EOSIO CDT and the software platform. Furthermore, we also spent time familiarizing ourselves with the EOSIO Blockchain Platform and the recommended IDE, EOSIO Studio. But soon after, the platform was easy to use and thus, connect and integrate smart contracts with our application.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We were successfully able to integrate the EOSIO blockchain platform in our application and thus ensure transparency through the voting transactions and more importantly, provide a secure platform to store the articles and their respective categories.

Additionally, we were able to develop a fully-functional cross-platform web and mobile application built using Flutter and Firebase respectively.

## What we learned
We were able to learn extensively about the EOSIO blockchain platform, understand its salient features when compared to other blockchain vendors. Moreover, we have realized the vast potential of research necessary in this field especially during this time of the pandemic in order to enable reliable news from trusted sources.

## What's next for Truth Seekers
We aim to partner up with sponsors to grow our reward and badges system. More importantly, be able to find a more optimum strategy to backup our scoring process, as well as, provide a global platform for qualified validators and users to combat fake news as a community.
